<h1 style="color:#FFD700"> Rock, Paper, Scissors AI</h1> 

> The Rock,Paper,Scissors game on stake gets on my nerves. I wanted to create an AI that will play for me and possibily get me paid. This project for the most part has achieved that, but whatever stake has evolves and becomes the terminator. In the begining this AI will lose and learn and it will start winning. It got me consistently to the 1000x - 2000x multipliers. Now for the most part it is nothing but draws, once in a while it will get me to 32x and sometimes 64x. Use your own judgement, do not completely rely on it. For example after five or six wins and draws it will tell me to play scissors, I choose Paper and either win or draw. Just remember that in the long run the house always wins and whatever AI stake has playing Rock, Paper, Scissors does not like to lose for long. Think of this AI as a companion rather than completely relying on it and you will do well. There is also an additional chart that displays its metrics as it learns.

<h2 style="color:#FF6347">Instructions</h2> 

1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install tensorflow for your current OS using pip
3. Install numpy
4. Install matplotlib
5. When first launching it will create a pkl file to save its learning progress.

<h3 style="color:#7CFC00"> Good Luck and I hope you get paid like I did </h3>

<h4 style="color:#008B8B"> If this AI has helped you please consider supporting me in this adventure </h4>

>I am working on a dragon tower pattern predictor now which seems promising.
